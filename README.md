# AOC-Assistant-A-Document-Grounded-Generative-AI
The AOC (Accounting) Assistant is a document-based generative AI system that:

1. Processes accounting PDFs (23-page limit) using PyPDF

2. Answers domain-specific questions using Google's Gemini API

3. Handles rate limits and model fallback gracefully

4. Provides citations from the document when possible

It demonstrates real-world accounting applications of GenAI while addressing practical challenges like API quotas and PDF processing.
